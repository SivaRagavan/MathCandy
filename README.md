MathCandy
=========

This Android App was built during Startup Weekend held around July 2012 in Hyderabad.

There are numerous games that are built for children 3-5 years in age. But this is the first one that exercises the math skills of a child along with a role-playing game experience. This unique experience makes the game interesting.
